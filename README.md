## 🚀 Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)**  
- **Safe division**: prevents dividing by zero using `if/else`  
- Operation selection using `switch` statements  
- Console-based, lightweight, and beginner-friendly  
- Clean and readable code for learning purposes
